# AIML+: Enhancing AIML for the Educational Domain through Frames and Large Language Models

**AIML+** is an advanced extension of **AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language)** designed to enhance dialogue systems, particularly in the **educational domain**.

This project, developed in **Python**, integrates AIML with **frame**, **dialogue act** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, making dialogue systems more flexible, context-aware, and suitable for advanced educational applications.
